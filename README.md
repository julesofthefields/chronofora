# Chronofora: How Google Maps sees the world

## Introduction

This project provides a framework to deform 2D surfaces in 3D according to custom metrics. In other words, it reshapes the geometry of a given closed 2D surface in 3D so that distances between any 2 points reflect a custom distance. In more pompous words, it tries to construct a quasi-isometric 2D embedding in a 3D space, of a 2D surface in 3D, seen under a custom metric. 
In this particular case, I wanted to deform the Earth, represented by the unit sphere in 3D, so that distances on the deformed surfaces would represent _at best_, in some sense of the terms, the travel times between 2 points. Chronofora is the name I have given to this new Earth-potato (but feel free to let me know if you have any better ideas).
The aim of this project is two-fold:
